//! Turn generation: the order in which a year happens.
//!
//! Source: `FGenerateTurn` (`10b0:0000`) and `Produce` (`10b8:0000`) in
//! `stars.2.7j.exe`. Full derivation in `docs/formulas/turn-order.md`.
//!
//! The original's pipeline is:
//!
//! ```text
//! DoOrders(0) → UnmarkMineFields → MoveThings(0) → MoveFleets →
//! ThingDecay → BreedColonistsInTransit → Produce → MoveThings(1) →
//! FuelFleets → DoOrders(1) → SweepForMines → HealShips →
//! AutoTerraform → RemoteTerraforming → SpankTheCheaters →
//! ValidateWaypoints → UpdateGuesses → turn++ → UpdatePlayerScores
//! ```
//!
//! and `Produce` itself is:
//!
//! ```text
//! MineMinerals → (per planet: resources → research skim → build queue)
//!              → UpdatePopulations → UpdateResearchStatus → RandomEvents
//! ```
//!
//! [`generate_turn`] implements the steps whose formulas are recovered. The
//! steps that need fleets, orders, ship designs or the components table are
//! listed in [`TurnReport::skipped`] rather than silently omitted, so a caller
//! can never mistake a partial turn for a complete one.
